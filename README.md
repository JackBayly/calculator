<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This project was pretty challenging for me. Getting all the different operators to work was difficult, as was getting the clear and equal buttons to work. It was good to get practice making a UI, especially using the grid layout in CSS. I like the end result. It's clean and nice to look at. The devil is definitely in the details with CSS. I put a lot of thought into almost every design choice, like the box shadows, box-radius, and colors. </p>
